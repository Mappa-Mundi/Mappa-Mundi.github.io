        <h1>Mappa Mundi - Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h3>At Mappa Mundi, we respect your privacy and commit to protecting it through our compliance with this
            policy.</h3>

        <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how Company Name ("we," "us," "our") handles your Personal Information,
            including your
            location data. Please read this policy carefully to understand our data practices. Your use of our
            services
            constitutes
            your agreement to this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h4>2. Information We Collect</h4>
        <p> To improve the user experience and enable certain features, we collect location data when you use our
            services. The
            location data collected is ephemeral on our servers, meaning it's only temporarily stored. </p>
        <h4>3. How We Collect Information</h4>
        <p>Our services may use technologies like GPS, Wi-Fi, or IP addresses to determine your device's approximate
            location.
            The
            collection of location data happens only with your explicit consent.</p>
        <h4>4. Use of Information</h4>
        <p>While the location data we collect is ephemeral on our servers, it is used to enhance your user
            experience and may be
            used for advertising purposes. We utilize Google AdMob for our advertising services.</p>
        <h4>5. Google AdMob</h4>
        <p>We use Google AdMob to display ads in our services. Google AdMob may use your location data to show you
            personalized
            ads. Their use of information is guided by Google's Privacy Policy, which we recommend you review.</p>
        <h4>6. Retention of Information</h4>
        <p>Given the ephemeral nature of the location data we collect, we do not retain this information on our
            servers beyond
            the
            necessary period required for its collection. Once the data collection process is completed, the data is
            automatically
            deleted from our servers.</p>
        <h4>7. Security of Information</h4>
        <p>We adopt appropriate data collection, storage, and processing practices, along with security measures to
            protect
            against
            unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal information.</p>
        <h4>8. Consent and Control</h4>
        <p>We only collect location data with your explicit consent. You can revoke this consent at any time through
            your device
            or
            application settings, but please note that some features of our services might not function properly
            without this
            data.</p>
        <h4>9. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h4>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy
            Policy
            on this page and updating the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
