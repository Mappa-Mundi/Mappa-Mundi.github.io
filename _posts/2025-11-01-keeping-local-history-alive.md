## The stories on our streets

Walk down any neighborhood street and you're surrounded by history. That corner store might have been a stop on the Underground Railroad. The modest row homes could have housed factory workers who shaped your city's industrial past. The shuttered church may have hosted civil rights meetings that changed your community forever.

Yet every year, thousands of these stories disappear. Buildings are demolished, documents are lost, and the people who remember fade away. Local history is essential community infrastructure; Mappa Mundi helps people find, map, and share it.

## Why local history matters

Preserving local history isn't nostalgia—it's civic infrastructure that shapes education, identity, and community resilience.

**Civic identity and belonging**: Historic places define who we are as communities. As the National Trust for Historic Preservation explains, "Old places help form, maintain, and transform civic identity—whether it's a city, county, state, region, country, or even the world."[^ntrust] When we lose these landmarks, we lose the physical anchors that tie us to shared experience.

**Education you can touch**: Historic sites offer something textbooks cannot: tangible, immersive learning. The National Park Service emphasizes that historic places "have powerful and provocative stories to tell" and serve as "witnesses to the past," making history concrete and accessible to students and lifelong learners alike.[^nps]

**Economic vitality**: Heritage tourism drives billions in economic activity annually. Preservation projects create jobs, increase property values, and revitalize neighborhoods. According to the Historic Hawai'i Foundation, "Historic preservation is a powerful economic engine," contributing to job creation and increased tax revenues while attracting visitors.[^hhf]

**Equity and representation**: Documenting diverse histories ensures all community members see their stories reflected in the public record. The National Trust's "Telling the Full History" initiative aims to sustain an inclusive American narrative that represents all peoples who shaped our communities.[^ntrust_fullhistory]

**Environmental sustainability**: Restoring existing structures is often more environmentally responsible than new construction. As Historic Hawai'i Foundation notes, "Restoring buildings—rather than building new ones, or demolishing existing ones" reduces waste and conserves resources.[^hhf]

## The problem: Fragile, scattered, and hard to find

Despite its importance, local history faces existential challenges:

**Lost archives**: Fire, flood, neglect, and simple passage of time claim historical documents every day. Family papers end up in dumpsters. Municipal records disappear during office moves. Small historical societies operate on shoestring budgets with minimal climate control.

**Digital decay and link rot**: Even when historical content moves online, it's vulnerable. Websites close, links break, and paywalls restrict access. A study might be cited dozens of times, but if the original URL goes dead, that knowledge becomes inaccessible to future researchers.

**Siloed collections**: Historical materials scatter across city halls, county archives, historical societies, libraries, family attics, and university collections. No single person knows what exists or where to find it. Comprehensive research becomes detective work.

**Time pressure on endangered sites**: Development moves fast. A historically significant building can be demolished in days, long before community members mobilize to document or save it. Once it's gone, reconstructing its history becomes exponentially harder.

## How Mappa Mundi helps

Mappa Mundi tackles these challenges by putting mapping tools and historical documentation in the hands of communities. Here's how the platform supports local history preservation:

### Open map of verified sites

Mappa Mundi provides a geolocated map where every historical site appears with coordinates, descriptions, photographs, and source links. Whether you're a teacher planning a field trip, a historian researching a neighborhood, or simply curious about the old building down the street, you can find verified information in one place—no subscription required.

### Community contributions with review

Residents know their neighborhoods best. Teachers uncover stories through student projects. Local historians spend decades researching a single block. Mappa Mundi invites all of them to contribute—whether that's proposing a new site, adding photographs, or correcting details. A light moderation process ensures accuracy while keeping the barrier to contribution low.

### Portable metadata

Mappa Mundi structures information using simple, universal fields: site title, date range, geographic coordinates, description, and source links. This portable metadata means your work travels well. Data exports in formats like GeoJSON ensure that even if platforms change, the historical record survives and remains compatible with other mapping and archival systems.

### Access in the field

The platform is mobile-friendly. Stand in front of a historic building, open Mappa Mundi, and read its story right there. This connection between place and narrative transforms casual walks into historical encounters and turns tourism into immersive education.

### Future-proofing

By prioritizing open formats, data export options, and standards-based design, Mappa Mundi ensures that today's documentation remains accessible tomorrow. Historical work should compound over time, not vanish when a platform shuts down or a file format becomes obsolete.

## Case-style snapshots

**The neighborhood schoolhouse**: A century-old brick school sits empty, scheduled for demolition to make room for condos. Local teachers and alumni use Mappa Mundi to document its history, gather photographs from former students, and map its significance. The public attention leads to reconsideration, and the building is adapted into affordable artist studios, preserving both structure and community memory.

**Workers' row homes**: Three blocks of modest 1920s row homes housed generations of factory workers and immigrants. When a developer proposes clearing them for luxury apartments, historians use Mappa Mundi to map each building and compile oral histories from residents. The documentation supports a successful historic district designation, protecting affordability and architectural character.

**The forgotten cemetery**: An overgrown African American cemetery, unmapped and unrecognized, is discovered by a student researching local Black history. She adds it to Mappa Mundi with coordinates, photographs, and historical context drawn from church records. Community members organize a cleanup, genealogists connect with descendants, and the site receives official recognition and ongoing care.

## How you can help

Preserving local history is a collective effort. Here's how you can contribute:

**Explore the map**: Start by discovering what's already documented in your area. Visit the [Mappa Mundi interactive map](https://mappamundi.io/map) and see what stories your neighborhood holds.

**Add a site or story**: Know about a historic building, event location, or landmark that should be documented? [Contribute your knowledge](https://mappamundi.io) to help expand the historical record. Add a description or comment to an existing site. 

**Share a photo or source**: Even small contributions matter. A single photograph, a newspaper clipping, or a link to a historical society page enriches everyone's understanding.

**Partner with us**: Teachers designing local history units, librarians connecting patrons with resources, and historical societies expanding their reach—all are invited to collaborate with Mappa Mundi.

If you find a site:

- **Research its significance**: Check local archives, historical society records, newspaper databases, or speak with long-time residents.
- **Document thoroughly**: Take clear photographs showing current conditions and architectural details.
- **Gather sources**: Note where you found information—URLs, book citations, archive references.
- **Submit to Mappa Mundi**: Add your findings so others can discover and build upon your work.
