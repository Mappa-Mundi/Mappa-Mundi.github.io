Today marks a significant milestone in our journey: **Mappa Mundi is now available on the web at [mappamundi.io](https://mappamundi.io/map)**.

Since our inception, we've been driven by a simple yet powerful idea: what if we could access the rich history that surrounds us every day? Too often, remarkable places and stories fade into the background of our daily lives. We pass by old buildings, forgotten landmarks, or the sites of pivotal events without ever knowing their significance.

With the launch of our web app, we're taking a major step forward in fulfilling that mission — making history more accessible, engaging, and relevant for everyone, everywhere.

## A Modern Mappa Mundi

The name "Mappa Mundi" comes from the Latin phrase meaning "map of the world" — a nod to the great medieval maps that once attempted to capture the entirety of human knowledge and geography. Those ancient cartographers created beautiful, intricate works that blended geography, history, and culture into a single view of the world.

In that same spirit, our web app is a modern interpretation of this ancient concept. We're creating a digital map that highlights and preserves the world's historical heritage for future generations, combining technology, community contributions, and historical research to make the past more accessible than ever before.

## Just the Beginning

The web app launch is an important step, but it's only the beginning. We're committed to continuously expanding our database, improving our features, and making Mappa Mundi an even more valuable resource for historical discovery.

We have exciting updates planned for the coming months, including:

- Enhanced search and filtering capabilities
- User contributions and community features
- History near me news feed
